If both are unavailable will use an in memory storage.\nExpiry is also implemented for all drivers not just cookies\nBreaking Changes in 2.0:\n\nWith 2.0 this library supports AoT. As a result there was two options, one to create a\nstorage type for each different storage, and two to change set/get and other methods\nto explicitly use a driver.\nThe latter means we can still provide in-memory fallback without\nthe hassle of you writing conditions everywhere.\nAll methods on locker now have an extra param for storage type such as get(DRIVERS.SESSION, 'key')\n\nGetting Started\n$ npm i --save angular-safeguardimport {NgModule} from '@angular/core'\nimport {LockerModule, Locker, DRIVERS} from 'angular-safeguard'\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app',\n  template: `...`\n})\nclass App {\n  constructor(locker: Locker) {\n    locker.set(DRIVERS.SESSION, 'something', value)\n  }\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [LockerModule],\n  declarations: [App],\n  bootstrap: [App]\n})\nclass AppModule {\n  constructor(private locker: Locker) {}\n}With Custom Config\nimport {LockerModule, LockerConfig, DRIVERS} from 'angular-safeguard'\n\n// to set a single driver\nconst lockerConfig = {\n  driverNamespace: 'nameSpace',\n  driverFallback: DRIVERS.MEMORY,\n  namespaceSeperator: '-'\n}\n\n// to set fallback drivers in order of preference, pass in an Array of Driver\nconst lockerConfig = {\n  driverNamespace: 'nameSpace',\n  driverFallback: [DRIVERS.LOCAL, DRIVERS.SESSION, DRIVERS.COOKIE],\n  namespaceSeperator: '-'\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [LockerModule.withConfig(lockerConfig)]\n  ...\n})\nclass SomeModule {\n\n}Methods\nget\nlocker.get(DRIVERS.SESSION, 'myKey')\nset\nlocker.set(DRIVERS.SESSION, 'myKey', 'value')\nlocker.set(DRIVERS.SESSION, 'myKey', {object: 'value'})\n\nconst expiry = new Date()\n\nexpiry.setHours(expiry.getHours() + 1)\n\nlocker.set(DRIVERS.SESSION, 'myKey', 'value', {expiry}) // will work with every driver type\n\n// You can also use set to pass options for cookies like maxAge and suchkey\nlocker.set(DRIVERS.COOKIES, 'key', 'value')\n\nlocker.key(DRIVERS.COOKIES, 0) // 'key'has\nlocker.has(DRIVERS.LOCAL, 'key')\nsetNamespace\nlocker.setNamespace('myName')\nlocker.setNamespace() // Resets to lockerConfig defaultsetSeparator\nlocker.setSeparator('myName')\nlocker.setSeparator() // Resets to lockerConfig defaultremove\nlocker.remove(DRIVERS.SESSION, 'key')\nclear\nlocker.clear(DRIVERS.SESSION)\nStatic Methods\nDRIVERS\nThese are the types of drivers available. If you try to set it to a (single) driver that is unsupported it will fallback to the memory driver.  To set fallback drivers, pass in an Array of drivers in the order or preference:\nAgain, if every driver in Array is unsupported, it will fall back to memory driver.\nTypes are available from import {DRIVERS} from 'angular-safeguard'\n\nDRIVERS.SESSION - Session Cache\nDRIVERS.LOCAL - Local Storage\nDRIVERS.MEMORY - Memory Storage\nDRIVERS.COOKIE - Cookies\n\nFAQ\nWhy is my data getting set to {data: myDataHere} instead of just myDataHere?:\nangular-safeguard provides expiry on more than just cookies, to do this it's necessary to create a bit of a more complex\nobject so we can store expiry and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\nOverview\n            \n                \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\ndependencies\n\nLegend\n\n  Declarations\n\n  Module\n\n  Bootstrap\n\n  Providers\n\n  Exports\n\ncluster_LockerModule\n\n\n\ncluster_LockerModule_providers\n\n\n\n\nLocker\n\nLocker\n\n\n\nLockerModule\n\nLockerModule\n\nLockerModule -->\n\nLocker->LockerModule\n\n\n\n\n\nLockerConfig\n\nLockerConfig\n\nLockerModule -->\n\nLockerConfig->LockerModule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                \n                \n                    Zoom in\n                    Reset\n                    Zoom out\n                \n            \n\n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            1 module\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        2 injectables\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        5 classes\n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        7 interfaces\n                    \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2016-2017 Mika Kalathil\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
